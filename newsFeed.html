            <h3>Public Release of NSS President's Personal E-mail</h3>
            <p>On March 12, 2018 personal e-mails were released to the public on a website operated by Jacob Henderson.  Mr. Henderson
                reportedly attended NSS (Nashville Software School), located in Nashville, TN, many years ago.  It is not clear what the motive would be if
                he actually is responsible for hacking into the e-mail system.  Some speculate he was still angry over the "Coffee Pot" incedent of 2017.
                While no one has come forward to say for sure Henderson is responsible, the Metro Police
                Department is investigating his likely involvement.
